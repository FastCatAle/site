            <h1>Simple Vim configuration</h1>
		    <img src="images/vimlogo.svg"/>
            <p>Vim is a terminal text editor with powerful motions that allows you to 
            quickly edit files from the terminal. However, by default it’s really 
            barebones and lacks some other basic features and settings that other 
            text editors have. This guide will show you how to easily configure vim 
            without using plugins.</p>

            <h2>What do we need?</h2>
            <p>Just install vim using your distribution’s package manager 
            (apt, apk, pacman, etc.), but chances are it’s already installed by default.</p>
            <p>You can check if it's installed by running the command:</p>
            <code>$ vim</code>
            <p>We are going to use Vim to edit Vim, so no need for anything else.</p>

            <h2>The "vimrc" file</h2>
            <p>You can run commands in Vim to change certain behavior, remap or add 
            keybinds, and more, but these commands stop taking effect once you close 
            the program. In order to make any changes persist, you can add them in a 
            file called <code>vimrc</code>. The location of this file it’s usually in your 
            <code>$HOME</code> and should be named <code>.vimrc</code> (yes, as a hidden file).</p>
            
            <p>If you have never used vim, I recommend typing vimtutor in your terminal 
            to learn the basics. On top of that, you can check out this website 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/">Learn Vimscript the Hard Way</a>,
            to learn vimscript too. No need to become an expert, just learn the 
            basics until you feel comfortable.</p>

            <h2>Interface settings</h2>
            <p>Let’s start by adding some basic settings that will change the 
            appearance of vim to make it look more like a text editor:</p>
            <code>
            syntax on<br>
            set number<br>
            set splitbelow<br>
            set splitright<br>
            set nowrap<br>
            set cursorline<br>
            set scrolloff=8<br>
            set wildmenu<br>
            set laststatus=2<br>
            set showmode<br>
            set colorcolumn=80<br>
            </code>

            <!-- TODO: Add a description for each setting -->

            <h2>Colors</h2>
            <p>Yes, you don’t need plugins to get colors on Vim. Of course, 
            if you want you can go ahead and download your favorite color scheme, 
            but I would advise you to first try the ones that come pre-installed with vim.</p>
            <p>Use the vim command <code>:colorscheme</code> and press TAB to cycle 
            through all the options (there are a lot of them!). However, many of them suck 
            if I’m being honest and the only two that I like are habamax and sorbet. 
            Since colorschemes are super easy to install and don’t require updates, 
            you can just use your favorite one. Here’s are some popular ones:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox" target="_blank">Gruvbox</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim" target="_blank"  >Tokyo Night</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/dracula/vim" target="_blank">Dracula</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/rose-pine/vim" target="_blank">Rosé Pine</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/vim" target="_blank">Catppuccin</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are a lot more, too many in fact, but if you still want to check more options go to 
            <a href="https://vimcolorschemes.com/" target="_blank">vimcolorschemes</a> for the (almost) full collection.</p>
            <p>Now that you have your favorite color scheme, let’s add it to the 
            configuration file. For this example I’m gonna be using habamax with a dark background:</p>
            <code>
            set termguicolors<br>
            set background=dark<br>
            colorscheme habamax<br>
            </code>

            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <p>At this point we can unlock the potential of Vim by adding keymaps, 
            which essentially are actions tied to certain keybinds. For example, 
            Vim comes with a built-in file explorer called Netrw, that allows you 
            to create and delete files and directories. You can access this file explorer 
            by typing the command <code>:Explore</code> or <code>:Ex</code>. 
            You can learn more about it by typing <code>:h netrw</code>. Because typing the 
            same command every time we want to open Netrw can become tedious, we can create 
            a keymap that will run the command when certain keys are pressed.</p>
            <p>For the purpose of adding keymaps that don’t interfere with other ones, 
            you can assign a “leader key” that when pressed lets you use custom keybinds. 
            To do this you can add the the vimrc:</p>
            <code>
            let mapleader = “ “<br>
            </code>
            <p>It’s common to use SPACE as your leader key since in normal mode it doesn’t do anything. 
            You could technically use any other key, but I would personally recommend 
            that you stick up with SPACE.</p>
            <p>With the leader key set, we can now create a keymap that opens Netrw like this:</p>
            <code>
            map &lt;leader&gt;p :Ex&lt;Cr&gt;<br>
            </code>
