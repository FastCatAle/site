		<h2>Vim as an IDE</h2>
		<p>
            This is a guide on how to make vim, a simple text editor, into a 
			relatively small IDE. I'm going to use some plugins to bring some 
			functionality like an lsp server, autocompletion and snippets, but 
			also "vanilla" settings to make the vim experience better.<br>

			btw I'm going to be using Linux for this, but I think it works the 
			same for Mac. Now, Windows users...<br>
		</p>

		<h3>Why not NeoVim?</h3>
		<p>
            Neovim is pretty much the same, just with extended functionality 
			thanks to Lua, which also brings some new (and sometimes better) 
			plugins. But that also means that you will have to get into some 
			lua scripting, so it comes more as a personal preference if you 
			want to deal with vim script or lua.<br>
		</p>

		<h2>Plugins</h2>
		<p>
            The idea is to keep things as simple as possible and reach a level 
			of "plug-and-play", so this are the plugins that we will be using:
			<ul>
				<li>vim-lsp</li>
				<li>vim-lsp-settings</li>
				<li>vim-lsp-ale</li>
				<li>ale</li>
				<li>asyncomplete</li>
				<li>asyncomplete-lsp</li>
				<li>vim-snip</li>
				<li>vim-snip-integ</li>
			</ul>

			Added to all this you are also going to need a package manager. Vim 
			already comes with one pre-installed, but its a little bit difficult 
			to manage since you will have to install, update and remove every 
			plugin manually; a package manager does all this things automatically.<br>

			You can find a lot of package managers, but the one the I like the 
			most is

		<h2>Plug: The package manager</h2>

		<p>
			To install Plug just paste this code into a terminal...<br>
			<code>
			    curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs 
                https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
            </code><br>
            This should install Plug into your <code>$HOME/.vim/</code> directory <br>
